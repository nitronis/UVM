# Deprecated API

In addition to the API deprecated in the 1800.2-2020 LRM, this library deprecates the following:

- Direct access to uvm_component::print_config_matches is deprecated in favor of new accessor methods, see [Mantis 6533](https://accellera.mantishub.io/view.php?id=6533).

# Installing the kit

Installation of UVM requires first unpacking the kit in a convenient
location.

```
    % mkdir path/to/convenient/location
    % cd path/to/convenient/location
    % gunzip -c path/to/UVM/distribution/tar.gz | tar xvf -
```

Follow the installation instructions provided by your tool vendor for
using this UVM installation and tool version dependencies.

# Prerequisites

- IEEE1800 compliant SV simulator. Please check with your tool vendor for exact tool version requirements.
- C compiler to compile the DPI code (if not otherwise provided by tool vendor)


# Library Release description

Each class and method in the standard is annotated in the implementation, allowing tools to identify 
the corresponding section in the standard. 

Example:
```
// @uvm-ieee 1800.2-2020 auto 16.5.3.2
extern virtual function void get_packed_bits (ref bit unsigned stream[]);
```

In addition to the APIs described in the standard, the Library includes the following categories of extra API:

1. APIs that are being considered for contribution to the IEEE by Accellera.  They are identified by the following annotation:
```
// @uvm-contrib Potential Contribution to 1800.2
```
2. APIs that are not being considered for contribution to the IEEE.  Generally these are provided for debug purposes.  They are identified by the following annotation:
```
// @uvm-accellera Accellera Implementation-specific API
```
3. Deprecated API\
**Note:** APIs deprecated in the 1800.2-2020 LRM are under a `` `ifdef UVM_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_API `` guard.  These APIs are
only supported when the deprecated API didn't contradict 1800.2-2020 API.  When `UVM_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_API` is defined
both the deprecated and 1800.2-2020 APIs are available.  When `UVM_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_API` is _not_ defined, the deprecated
APIs are not available, and any code referencing them will miscompile.\
\
These APIs will only be supported until the next release of the 1800.2 standard.  Code leveraging these deprecated APIs
should be migrated to 1800.2-2020 standard APIs to maintain compatibility with future versions of the implementation. \
\
By default, `UVM_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_API` is not  defined. 
4. APIs used within the library that are not intended to be directly used outside of the implementation.

**Note:** While the Accellera UVM Working Group supports the APIs described in (1), (2) and (3) above, these APIs are technically not a part of the 1800.2 standard.  As such, any code which leverages these APIs may not be portable to alternative 1800.2 implementations.  

# Backwards Compatibility Concerns

These are instances wherein the functionality of an API that exists in both UVM 1.2 and the IEEE 1800.2 standard has changed in a non 
backwards-compatible manner.

1. [Mantis 7082](https://accellera.mantishub.io/view.php?id=7082) Arguments and fields in uvm_mem_mam, uvm_mem_mam_cfg, and uvm_mem_region have changed from type "bit [63:0]" to the typedef uvm_reg_addr_t.
                             
2. [Mantis 7090](https://accellera.mantishub.io/view.php?id=7090) The uvm_split_string method has been deprecated in favor of uvm_string_split.  The command line processor now uses uvm_string_split.  The difference is that uvm_split_string did not create any empty strings, so ",,xxx,," would not be treated any differently than "xxx".  Now with uvm_string_split, ",,xxx,," will be interpreted as two empty strings, then "xxx", then two more empty strings.



# Migration instructions

In order to migrate to the Library version of the release, It is recommended that you perform the following steps to get your code to 
run with this release of UVM. 

1. Compile/Run using a UVM 1800.2-2017 library with `UVM_NO_DEPRECATED` defined. This will ensure that your code runs 
with UVM 1800.2-2017 which was a baseline for the UVM 1800.2-2020 library development.  

**Note:** All code deprecated in UVM 1800.2-2017 has been removed from this version of the library.

2. Compile/Run using this library with `UVM_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_API` defined.  This step helps identify the areas where your code may need modifications to comply with the standard.


3. Compile/Run using this library without `UVM_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_API` defined. Removing the define ensures that only the 1800.2 API documented in the standard, along with any non-deprecation accellera supplied API, is used.  Any new compile failures are the result of deprecated 1800.2-2017 APIs.
